# Fish Distribution App

## Project Overview
The Fish Distribution App is an Android application that allows users to query the distribution of fish species. By entering a fish species name or selecting it from a dropdown menu, users can send requests to a backend API and retrieve distribution data (latitude and longitude) for the selected fish species. The app uses HTTP requests, JSON data parsing, and Android UI to display the results.

## Features
- **Fish Selection**: Users can select a fish species from a dropdown menu or enter it manually.
- **Distribution Query**: The app sends a query to the backend API to fetch the distribution data of the selected fish species in North America.
- **Result Display**: The app displays the fish distribution, including latitude and longitude coordinates.

## Technologies Used
- **Android SDK**: For building the native Android application.
- **Gson**: For JSON data parsing.
- **HTTP**: For sending requests to a backend API.
- **Java**: Programming language for Android development.
